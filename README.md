# Spring Boot REST API for FreeLancer Management System

This project is a Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API to manage freelancers.
It supports the registration, update, deletion of freelancers, and notifies a separate notification service of
these events asynchronously.

## Features

1. **Freelancer Registration, Update, and Deletion**: Freelancers can register themselves with first name, last name, date of birth, and gender. They can also update or delete their profiles.
2. **Async Notification**: Every time a freelancer registers, updates, or deletes their profile, an asynchronous notification is sent to the Notification Service, which processes and persists the event.
3. **Freelancer Verification**: Staff users are responsible for approving freelancers. All newly registered freelancers are listed for staff users to verify, and once verified, the freelancer's status changes from `NEW_FREELANCER` to `VERIFIED`.
4. **Deleted Freelancers Retrieval**: Staff users can also fetch all freelancers who marked their profiles for deletion in the last 7 days.

## Architecture Overview

This project uses the following components:
- **Spring Boot**: As the main framework to build RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For interacting with the database using JPA repositories.
- **Spring Kafka**: For async communication between services using Kafka.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: To generate API documentation.
- **JUnit and Mockito**: For unit testing the application.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main services:
1. **Freelancer Service**: Manages freelancer registration, updates, and deletion.
2. **Notification Service**: Receives notifications of freelancer events asynchronously and persists them.

## Dependencies

Here are the main dependencies used in this project:
- Spring Boot 1.5.22.RELEASE
- Spring Data JPA
- Kafka
- Swagger for API documentation
- JUnit 4 for unit testing
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
1. JDK 1.8
2. Apache Kafka
3. Docker and Docker Compose
4. Maven

## Running the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd freelancer
```

### 2. Run Kafka
Start the Kafka broker using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Run the Application
Maven is used to build the code
To run the Spring Boot application:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 4. Access the Application
- **API Documentation (Swagger UI)**: `http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html`
- **API Endpoints**:
  - POST /api/freelancers: Register a freelancer.
  - PUT /api/freelancers/{id}: Update freelancer details.
  - DELETE /api/freelancers/{id}: Delete a freelancer.

### 5. Running Tests
Run unit tests using:
```bash
mvn test
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Kafka for Asynchronous Communication**: We chose Kafka to ensure reliable, decoupled communication between the Freelancer and Notification services.
2. **Docker**: Containerization ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments.
3. **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies database access and management through the repository pattern.
